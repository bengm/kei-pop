      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email that the truck has been &amp;rsquo;line released&amp;rsquo;. What does that mean? Still finding out. It takes so many hands to make international shipping work, which makes sense. That email was I think from the company that operates the ship. They referred me to the operator of the terminal at the port. When I contact the terminal, it turns out it has a Customs Entry Hold. I contact my broker, who informed me that &amp;ldquo;something is going on in Baltimore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll see how long it takes. Then I get to figure out how to actually pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>At Sea</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My bill of lading arrived. That means I have a ship, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9561265&#34;&gt;Elegant Ace&lt;/a&gt;, which will carry the truck across the Pacific, through the Panama canal, an ultimately to Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means I need to get the import paperwork in order. The process has been a bit confusing, with the company facilitating the sale giving me mixed recommendations - either doing paperwork myself with the help of easyISF, or using a broker. I ended up using a broker, but not sure if that was the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Auction Winner!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I won an auction. It took a few attempts and false starts, but I won the auction for a 1998 Subaru Sambar KS4. Manual transmission, A/C, and apparently pretty good exteror and interior condition - and at just under 30K kilometers on the dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process: I used Japan Car Direct as the facilitator/agent. After signing up, a lot of the process was via Whatsapp, where they would show potential upcoming auction vehicles that meet my general criteria, and I&amp;rsquo;d give feedback on which I was willing to potentially bid on. On auction day, they would order same-day third party inspections. I had to be pretty available at that time for feedback (usually Thursday or Friday night in East-coast US time to correspond to Friday or Saturday morning auctions in Japan). When the inspection came back good, I gave the thumbs up and a ceiling amount to bid, and they carried it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I won at 454K Yen. The various fees for the auction, agent suppport, and transport fees to the US got that up to about $880k Yen total, or $6217 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sent some pictures of the truck in the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
