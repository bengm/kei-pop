            <p>I got an email that the truck has been &rsquo;line released&rsquo;. What does that mean? Still finding out. It takes so many hands to make international shipping work, which makes sense. That email was I think from the company that operates the ship. They referred me to the operator of the terminal at the port. When I contact the terminal, it turns out it has a Customs Entry Hold. I contact my broker, who informed me that &ldquo;something is going on in Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how long it takes. Then I get to figure out how to actually pick it up.</p>

            <p>My bill of lading arrived. That means I have a ship, <a href="https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9561265">Elegant Ace</a>, which will carry the truck across the Pacific, through the Panama canal, an ultimately to Baltimore.</p>
<p>This also means I need to get the import paperwork in order. The process has been a bit confusing, with the company facilitating the sale giving me mixed recommendations - either doing paperwork myself with the help of easyISF, or using a broker. I ended up using a broker, but not sure if that was the best choice.</p>

            <p>I won an auction. It took a few attempts and false starts, but I won the auction for a 1998 Subaru Sambar KS4. Manual transmission, A/C, and apparently pretty good exteror and interior condition - and at just under 30K kilometers on the dial.</p>
<p>The process: I used Japan Car Direct as the facilitator/agent. After signing up, a lot of the process was via Whatsapp, where they would show potential upcoming auction vehicles that meet my general criteria, and I&rsquo;d give feedback on which I was willing to potentially bid on. On auction day, they would order same-day third party inspections. I had to be pretty available at that time for feedback (usually Thursday or Friday night in East-coast US time to correspond to Friday or Saturday morning auctions in Japan). When the inspection came back good, I gave the thumbs up and a ceiling amount to bid, and they carried it out.</p>
<p>I won at 454K Yen. The various fees for the auction, agent suppport, and transport fees to the US got that up to about $880k Yen total, or $6217 USD.</p>
<p>They sent some pictures of the truck in the yard.</p>
