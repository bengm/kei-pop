I got an email that the truck has been 'line released'. What does that mean? Still finding out. It takes so many hands to make international shipping work, which makes sense. That email was I think from the company that operates the ship. They referred me to the operator of the terminal at the port. When I contact the terminal, it turns out it has a Customs Entry Hold. I contact my broker, who informed me that "something is going on in Baltimore."

We'll see how long it takes. Then I get to figure out how to actually pick it up.
